# Sign-Out Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
When users pressed the "Sign Out" button, the app would load the splash screen instead of redirecting to the login page, creating a confusing user experience.

## Root Cause
The navigation logic in `AppNavigator.tsx` was setting the `initialRouteName` to "Splash" for unauthenticated users, but there was no automatic navigation to the Login screen after sign-out. This meant users would see the splash screen instead of being taken to the login page.

## Solution Implemented

### Navigation Logic Fix
Updated the `AppNavigator.tsx` to change the initial route for unauthenticated users from "Splash" to "Login":

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
<Stack.Navigator initialRouteName={isAuthenticated ? "MainApp" : "Splash"}>

// After (fixed)
<Stack.Navigator initialRouteName={isAuthenticated ? "MainApp" : "Login"}>
```

### Authentication Flow
The fix ensures the following flow:

1. **User Signs Out**: 
   - `authService.signOut()` is called
   - `currentUser` is set to `null`
   - Auth state listeners are notified with `null`
   - `isAuthenticated` becomes `false`

2. **Navigation Update**:
   - `AppNavigator` detects `isAuthenticated` is `false`
   - Sets `initialRouteName` to "Login"
   - User is automatically redirected to the Login screen

3. **User Experience**:
   - No more splash screen after sign-out
   - Direct navigation to login page
   - Clear and intuitive flow

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`**
   - Changed `initialRouteName` from "Splash" to "Login" for unauthenticated users
   - This ensures users go directly to login after sign-out

### Authentication Service:
The existing `authService.signOut()` method was already working correctly:
```typescript
async signOut(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    console.log('Signing out user...');
    this.currentUser = null;
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('currentUser');
    this.notifyAuthStateListeners(null);
    console.log('Sign out successful');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign out error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Benefits:
- ✅ **Proper Navigation**: Users are taken directly to login page after sign-out
- ✅ **Better UX**: No confusing splash screen in the middle of the flow
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Matches user expectations for sign-out functionality
- ✅ **Clean Flow**: Sign-out → Login page (as expected)

## Testing
The fix should be tested by:
1. Signing in to the app
2. Navigating to the Profile screen
3. Pressing "Sign Out"
4. Verifying the app goes directly to the Login screen (not splash screen)

This fix complements the previous navigation bar overlap fix, ensuring both the UI layout and navigation flow work correctly throughout the application.
