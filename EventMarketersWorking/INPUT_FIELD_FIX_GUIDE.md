# Input Field Closing Issue - Fix Guide

## Problem Description
Users reported that "The form input fields are closing automatically after inserting a text in the input field". This issue was causing TextInput components to lose focus unexpectedly during typing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Component Recreation
The main cause was in `RegistrationScreen.tsx` where the `FloatingInput` component was being recreated on every render due to `useMemo` dependencies including `focusedField`. This caused the TextInput to lose focus when the component re-rendered.

### Secondary Issues
1. **ScrollView Configuration**: Missing `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` and `keyboardDismissMode` properties
2. **TextInput Properties**: Missing `blurOnSubmit` and `returnKeyType` properties for better focus management

## Fixes Applied

### 1. RegistrationScreen.tsx
**Issue**: `FloatingInput` component recreation
```typescript
// Before (problematic) - Component defined inside main component with useMemo
const FloatingInput = useMemo(() => ({ ... }) => (...), [focusedField, theme]);

// After (fixed) - Component moved outside main component with React.memo
const FloatingInput = React.memo(({ 
  label, 
  value, 
  onChangeText, 
  field,
  focusedField,
  setFocusedField,
  theme,
  // ... other props
}: any) => (
  // ... component implementation
));
```

**Added TextInput properties**:
```typescript
blurOnSubmit={false}
returnKeyType="next"
autoCorrect={false}
spellCheck={false}
textContentType="none"
```

### 2. BusinessProfileForm.tsx
**Added ScrollView properties**:
```typescript
<ScrollView 
  style={styles.content} 
  showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
  keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"
  keyboardDismissMode="none"
>
```

**Added TextInput properties**:
```typescript
blurOnSubmit={false}
returnKeyType="next"
```

### 3. LoginScreen.tsx
**Issue**: `FloatingInput` component recreation
```typescript
// Before (problematic) - Component defined inside main component with useMemo
const FloatingInput = useMemo(() => ({ ... }) => (...), [theme]);

// After (fixed) - Component moved outside main component with React.memo
const FloatingInput = React.memo(({ 
  label, 
  value, 
  onChangeText, 
  onFocus, 
  onBlur, 
  isFocused, 
  theme,
  // ... other props
}: any) => (
  // ... component implementation
));
```

**Added TextInput properties**:
```typescript
blurOnSubmit={false}
returnKeyType="next"
autoCorrect={false}
spellCheck={false}
textContentType="none"
```

## Key Properties Explained

### `blurOnSubmit={false}`
- Prevents the TextInput from losing focus when the user presses the return/enter key
- Allows for better form navigation flow

### `returnKeyType="next"`
- Changes the return key text to "Next" on the keyboard
- Provides better UX indication for form navigation

### `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`
- Prevents the keyboard from dismissing when tapping on the ScrollView
- Ensures input fields maintain focus during scrolling

### `keyboardDismissMode="none"`
- Prevents the keyboard from being dismissed when scrolling
- Maintains focus on the active TextInput

### `textContentType="none"`
- Prevents iOS from trying to auto-fill the input field
- Reduces potential conflicts with keyboard behavior

### `autoCorrect={false}`
- Disables autocorrect which can interfere with typing
- Prevents unwanted text changes that might cause focus loss

### `spellCheck={false}`
- Disables spell checking which can cause keyboard behavior issues
- Reduces potential conflicts with input focus

## Testing Checklist

After applying these fixes, test the following scenarios:

1. **Basic Typing**: Type in any input field and verify it doesn't lose focus
2. **Form Navigation**: Use the return/next key to move between fields
3. **Scrolling**: Scroll the form while typing to ensure focus is maintained
4. **Modal Forms**: Test BusinessProfileForm modal specifically
5. **Keyboard Behavior**: Verify keyboard doesn't dismiss unexpectedly

## Prevention Tips

1. **Avoid `useMemo` with frequently changing dependencies** for components containing TextInput
2. **Always include proper ScrollView properties** when forms contain scrollable content
3. **Use consistent TextInput properties** across all forms
4. **Test focus behavior** during development, especially with complex forms

## Files Modified

2. `EventMarketers/src/components/BusinessProfileForm.tsx`
3. `EventMarketers/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The input field closing issue has been resolved through the systematic application of the above fixes. All forms should now maintain proper focus during user interaction.

### Final Fix Applied: BusinessProfileForm.tsx
**Issue**: `FloatingInput` component recreation (same as other forms)
```typescript
// Before (problematic) - Component defined inside main component
const FloatingInput = ({ ... }) => (...);

// After (fixed) - Component moved outside main component with React.memo
const FloatingInput = React.memo(({ 
  label, 
  value, 
  onChangeText, 
  field, 
  placeholder, 
  focusedField,
  setFocusedField,
  theme,
  // ... other props
}: {
  // ... proper TypeScript interface
}) => (
  // ... component implementation
));
```

**Updated all FloatingInput usages** to pass required props:
```typescript
<FloatingInput
  label="Company Name *"
  value={formData.name}
  onChangeText={(value) => handleInputChange('name', value)}
  field="name"
  placeholder="Enter company name"
  focusedField={focusedField}
  setFocusedField={setFocusedField}
  theme={theme}
/>
```
